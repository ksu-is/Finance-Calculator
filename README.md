# Finance-Calculator
This is a project that allows users to input variables for calculating NPV's  and presenting them with answers within a GUI format.
Since I am a Finance major, this project combines my major with this class, to make it relevant to my other courses. This program will be able to solve complicated financial equations, including Net Present Value, Internal Rate of Return, and Profitability Index, and will answer whether or not a company should take a a new project on or not.
This program should be able to take in user input for several factors, including required rate of return, tax rate, initial outlay, operating cash flows, and termination values and return the values plus a "yes" or "no" decision on the project based on whether the NPV is greater than 0. 
https://github.com/rajatk16/npv-costbenefit-analysis/blob/master/Sudagade%20-%20Assignment4.py This is a good example of code that could be used as a basis for examining to begin this type of project. My Finance Calculator project varies from it though, for I want to have the user able to input their information into the calculator. I will design a platform similar to the CalcGUI project we did earlier this semester, except a more advanced form.
